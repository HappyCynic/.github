# Happy Cynic Software LLC

> *Useful software. Skeptically designed.*

Happy Cynic Software is an independent software studio focused on building clever, opinionated tools for real people. Led by a solo founder with a background in thoughtful design and a healthy distrust of hype, Happy Cynic creates software that's practical, purposeful, and just a little bit skeptical.

## 🧠 What We Do

Happy Cynic designs and develops software grounded in a few clear principles:

- ✨ Utility over novelty  
- 🧼 Clean, calm UX  
- 🛠️ Lightweight, purposeful features  
- 😏 A touch of dry wit  
- 🚫 No bloat. No BS.

Every product released is built with intention — the kind of software we'd actually want to use.

## 📦 Projects

### [Preppd](https://github.com/HappyCynic/preppd)
*Smarter trip prep. Half the panic.*

Preppd is a travel preparation app that helps users pack with confidence. It creates intelligent packing lists based on destination, weather, trip duration, and traveler profiles. It’s designed to reduce stress, eliminate overpacking, and remember the little things — like chargers, passports, and dignity.

More tools are in the works, released on a "when it's ready" schedule — not on a VC's timeline.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Happy Cynic doesn’t chase trends or build for buzzwords.  
The goal is to make software that feels like a helpful companion — calm, capable, and quietly clever.

## 🛠️ Contributing

Happy Cynic is currently a solo operation, but contributions, ideas, and thoughtful critique are always welcome. If something resonates, feel free to reach out.
